Sudhi's Script Hacks
====================
These are some of the scripts I wrote to make my life interesting.
I contribute it to the world so that others may enjoy.


Most of the scripts come with some sort of help message
(``--help``). If not, the use of the script ought to be evident.

License
=======
Most of the scripts are GPLv2. Some are with a more liberal (BSD)
license. Don't ask - its just my preference.

Brief Blurb about Each
======================

mkgetopt
--------
This subdirectory has a standalone Python tool to generate command line
parsing code for use in C/C++ programs. It uses ``getopt_long()``
and removes tedium around command line processing. It comes with a
manpage and examples.

Scripts
-------
Many of these scripts have builtin help (``--help``); they are
identified with a suffix of ``*``. ::

    abspath            when you need command line access to os.path.abspath()
    isabs              when you need command line access to os.path.isabs()
    realpath           when you need command line access to os.path.realpath()
    aes-test.sh        Self-test for aes.py (tests various sizes)
    mk-raw-vmware.py   The name says it all; make a raw disk with no holes
    randmac            Print a semi-random mac address
    rename             Rename files based on regex. Yes, its Perl.
    rotatedir          Rotate a directory with newest name ending in .0 suffix
    xdump              I forget how to use hexdump. Hence this short alias

    server-backup      Script I use to backup remote machines via SSH. Customize it for
                       your use case.

    aes.py          *  AES encrypt a file in CTR mode with random salt
    cert-tool.py    *  Tool to turn you into a light weight X.509 CA
    comic2pdf       *  If you have bunch of CBRs and want PDFs instead
    deadlinks       *  Show me symlinks that point to non existent files
    dos2unix.py     *  Turn CRLF into LF
    finddup         *  If you have identical files strewn around in your file system
    hexlify         *  hexlificate your stdin

    pardu.py        *  Parallel, pure-python version of du. Possibly
                       faster than the native version on your machine. 
                       alias du=pardu.py is the recommended way.

    kill.py         *  Cross platform, interactive way to kill processes by name/PID
                       alias kill=kill.py  works very nicely.
                       'q' in the prompt cleanly exits the tool.

    rm.py           *  Cross platform, interactive way to remove files
                       alias rm=rm.py  saves you from unwanted pain.
                       'q' in the prompt cleanly exits the tool.

    make-tunnel.py  *  Create IPSec tunnels with preshared keys (site-to-site VPN). Tested on
                       Linux, easy to adapt to other OSes.

    pingsubnet.py   *  Ping multiple addresses in parallel for a subnet and get results back;
    randpass        *  Experiments in generating random passwords
    rsync-backup.py *  Backup using rsync and hardlinks
    tolower         *  Play with file names and their case. Try 'tolower --help'

ovpn-tool.py      
------------
So, you want to run your own OpenVPN server. And then you decide to get adventerous and offer it to
your friends and family. Now, you have to worry about authentication and mobile devices. This
utility is designed to make your life easy to manage a small OpenVPN server and generate client
certs, client configs etc. The generated ``.ovpn`` file is also usable on iOS and Android.

Comes with builtin help ``ovpn-tool.py  --help``.

OS X Tools
----------
These are some OS X specific tools that make your life interesting.::

    mkdmg.sh          Make OS X compressed disk image from a source directory
    gone.sh           Nuke your OS X root/boot disk. Use with care :-)

The next set of utilities work with ``launchd(8)`` to make their behavior persistent across boots.
You can run them in one-shot mode on the command line or use the ``install`` option to relegate it
to launchd control.::

    osx-ipfw.sh       Enable ipfw(8) with a default set of secure rules
    osx-noatime.sh    Enable noatime mounts on all disks
    osx-ramfs.sh      Put /tmp and /var/run under a RAMFS
    osx-randmac.sh    Randomize your MAC address at every boot. Designed to auto-detect your wifi
                      interface and use it with that.
    osx-tuntap.sh     Make your tun-tap driver persistent.


The ramfs.sh and randmac.sh files have been tested to work on OS X Yosemite.

Linux Specific Tools
--------------------
::

    find-usb-disk     List USB disks - for those of us who dislike systemd
    linktest.py       Test link status of ethernet interface(s)

kern-build
~~~~~~~~~~
If you are in the embedded systems world - building and using custom linux kernels, then you'll love
this utility. It allows you to build multiple kernel images from a single source directory. It
took life during the reign of 2.6.12. I've kept it more or less up-to-date through modern 3.x
kernels. Haven't tried it on 4.x yet.

I used it regularly to build kernels for UML, x86 and mips. If you add other Arch's and their
aliases, send me patches.

openbsd-randmac.sh 
------------------
This script is incomplete - it generates a random mac address and sets it on the interface. But, one
needs a place from whence to call this. Haven't figured out exactly where to do that. Patches
welcome.

disablecaps.inf
---------------
A long time ago, I used to do a lot of work on Windows - especially writing ARM instruction set
emulators. And, I wanted a way to disable CapsLock permanently. I figured out this hack to make it
happen. I haven't tested in on a more recent Windows 7/8/10. If you find this useful, drop me a
note.
